## Final Answer

I need permission to access Honeycomb's API to query your data. Please grant access to the Honeycomb tools so I can:

1. List your environments to confirm "ms-demo" exists
2. Query your datasets to find the slowest endpoints across all services
3. Analyze performance data from the past 24 hours

Once you grant the permissions, I'll be able to find the slowest endpoints by querying for high percentile response times across all your services.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 - System Init

**Content:** Claude Code initialized (model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
Working directory: /workspace
Available tools (25): Task, Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoRead, TodoWrite, WebSearch, mcp__honeycomb__feedback, mcp__honeycomb__get_triggers, mcp__honeycomb__hny_datasets_columns, mcp__honeycomb__hny_datasets_get, mcp__honeycomb__hny_datasets_list, mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_get, mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_list, mcp__honeycomb__query, mcp__honeycomb__query_history, mcp__honeycomb__team_info
MCP servers (1): honeycomb

### Step 2 - Text Response

**Content:** I'll help you find the slowest endpoints across all services in the ms-demo environment from the past 24 hours using Honeycomb.

### Step 3 - Tool Use

**Content:** Using tool: mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_list

**Tool:** mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_list
### Step 4 - Tool Result

**Content:** Tool result: Claude requested permissions to use mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_list, but you haven't granted it yet.


**Tool Output:**
```
Claude requested permissions to use mcp__honeycomb__hny_environments_list, but you haven't granted it yet.
```
