Comprehensive integration test combining multiple MCP server capabilities:

1. Use the filesystem server to read a configuration file that contains a list of URLs
2. Use the web fetch server to download content from each URL in the configuration
3. Analyze the downloaded content and extract key information (titles, word counts, etc.)
4. Use the filesystem server to create a summary report file with the analysis results
5. If database server is available, store the results in a database table
6. Create a final report that combines file operations, web content analysis, and data storage

Multi-server coordination test:
1. Read project structure using filesystem server
2. Fetch documentation from project website using fetch server
3. Query database for related project metrics (if available)
4. Generate a comprehensive project analysis report
5. Save the report to multiple formats (JSON, markdown, CSV)

Success criteria:
- Data flows correctly between different MCP servers
- Each server type contributes its specialized functionality
- Error handling works when one server fails while others continue
- Final output integrates information from all available servers
- Report generation completes successfully with properly formatted data
- All operations coordinate smoothly without conflicts or resource issues
- The evaluation demonstrates practical real-world usage patterns
