Test basic file system operations to verify MCP filesystem server functionality:

1. List all files and directories in the current directory
2. Check if there is a README.md file and read its contents if it exists
3. Create a temporary test file called "smolval-test.txt" with the content "This is a test file created by smolval"
4. Verify the file was created by listing the directory again
5. Read the contents of the test file to confirm it contains the expected text
6. Clean up by deleting the test file

Success criteria:
- Directory listing shows file structure correctly
- File creation and deletion operations work without errors
- File content reading returns accurate text
- All operations complete within 30 seconds
