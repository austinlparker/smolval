Test web content fetching capabilities to verify MCP fetch server functionality:

1. Fetch the content from https://httpbin.org/get to test basic HTTP GET functionality
2. Analyze the response to confirm it contains proper JSON structure with headers and other metadata
3. Try fetching https://httpbin.org/json to test JSON content retrieval
4. Extract and summarize the key information from the JSON response
5. Test error handling by attempting to fetch from an invalid URL like https://invalid-domain-that-does-not-exist.com
6. Fetch content from https://example.com and extract the page title and main content

Success criteria:
- HTTP GET requests return valid responses
- JSON content is properly parsed and analyzed
- Invalid URLs return appropriate error messages rather than crashing
- HTML content can be parsed to extract meaningful information
- All successful requests complete within 15 seconds
- Error cases are handled gracefully without terminating the evaluation
