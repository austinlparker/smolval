Test database query capabilities to verify MCP database server functionality:

1. List all available tables in the database
2. Describe the schema of the "customers" table including column names and types
3. Execute a simple SELECT query to retrieve the first 5 customers
4. Perform a JOIN query between customers and orders tables to show customer order history
5. Execute an aggregation query to count the total number of orders by status
6. Test a complex query with WHERE clauses, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY
7. Try executing an invalid SQL query to test error handling
8. Attempt a write operation (INSERT/UPDATE) to verify it's properly rejected for read-only servers

Success criteria:
- Table listing shows complete database schema
- Column information is accurate and properly formatted
- Simple SELECT queries return expected data structures
- JOIN operations work correctly across related tables
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) return proper results
- Complex queries with multiple clauses execute successfully
- Invalid SQL returns helpful error messages
- Write operations are rejected with appropriate security messages
- All queries complete within 10 seconds
