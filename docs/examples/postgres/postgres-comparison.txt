You are testing READ-ONLY PostgreSQL MCP server functionality. These servers are designed for data analysis and querying only, not data modification. Please perform the following comprehensive read-only database operations:

1. **Schema Discovery & Introspection**:
   - List all available tables in the database
   - Get the schema/structure for any existing tables
   - List all available columns and their data types
   - Discover indexes, constraints, and relationships if possible
   - Check what database version and capabilities are available

2. **Basic Query Operations** (if tables exist):
   - Query all records from available tables (limit results to avoid overwhelming output)
   - Count total records in each table
   - Get distinct values from categorical columns
   - Show sample data from each table

3. **Advanced Read-Only Queries** (if data exists):
   - Group data by categories and show counts
   - Calculate aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
   - Use WHERE clauses to filter data
   - Join multiple tables if relationships exist
   - Search for patterns using LIKE or ILIKE
   - Order results by different columns

4. **Query Complexity Testing**:
   - Test subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
   - Try window functions if supported
   - Test CASE statements and conditional logic
   - Try complex WHERE conditions with AND/OR
   - Test date/time functions and formatting

5. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**:
   - Try to query a non-existent table
   - Try malformed SQL syntax
   - Test queries with invalid column names
   - Try to run write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) - these should fail
   - Test connection limits and timeout behavior

6. **Performance & Capabilities**:
   - Test query execution on larger result sets
   - Check available PostgreSQL functions and extensions
   - Test different data types (text, numeric, date, boolean, JSON)
   - Examine connection information and server metadata
   - Check what SQL features are supported vs restricted

**Expected Behavior**: 
- All SELECT queries should work
- Schema introspection should be available
- Any write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP) should be rejected
- Error messages should be clear and helpful

Please execute these operations systematically and report on:
- Which read operations succeed/fail
- Differences in query syntax support between servers
- Quality and detail of schema information provided
- Error messages and handling for both valid and invalid queries
- Performance characteristics for complex queries
- Overall usability for data analysis tasks

Goal: Provide a comprehensive comparison of read-only PostgreSQL MCP server capabilities for data analysis and querying.
