Web Fetch Server Evaluation

Test the web fetching MCP server capabilities:

1. Fetch the content from https://httpbin.org/get to test basic HTTP GET functionality
2. Extract and report the origin IP address from the response
3. Try fetching JSON data from https://httpbin.org/json
4. Parse the JSON response and summarize the slideshow information
5. Test error handling by attempting to fetch from an invalid URL like https://this-domain-does-not-exist-12345.com
6. Fetch content from https://example.com and extract the page title

Success criteria:
- Successfully retrieves content from valid URLs
- Properly parses JSON responses
- Gracefully handles invalid URLs with appropriate error messages
- Extracts specific information from web pages
- Response times are reasonable (under 10 seconds per request)

This evaluation tests HTTP client functionality, JSON parsing, and error handling.
