Filesystem Server Evaluation

Test the filesystem MCP server capabilities with these operations:

1. List all files in the current directory to understand the project structure
2. Create a test directory called "eval_test_files"
3. Create a text file inside the test directory with content "Hello from smolval evaluation"
4. Read the content back to verify it was written correctly
5. List the contents of the test directory to confirm the file exists
6. Clean up by removing the test directory and its contents

Success criteria:
- All directory and file operations complete without errors
- File content is accurately written and read back
- Directory cleanup is successful
- No permission or access errors occur

This evaluation tests basic CRUD operations for file system interaction.
