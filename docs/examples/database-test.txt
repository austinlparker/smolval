Database Server Evaluation

Test the database MCP server capabilities:

1. List all available tables in the database to understand the schema
2. Describe the structure of the "customers" table including column names and types
3. Execute a simple SELECT query to retrieve the first 5 customers
4. Perform a JOIN query between customers and orders tables
5. Execute an aggregation query to count orders by status
6. Test a more complex query with WHERE clauses and GROUP BY
7. Try to execute an invalid SQL statement to test error handling
8. Attempt a write operation (INSERT/UPDATE) to verify read-only enforcement

Success criteria:
- Successfully lists database schema information
- Executes SELECT queries and returns properly formatted results
- Handles JOIN operations between multiple tables
- Performs aggregations (COUNT, SUM, etc.) correctly
- Returns meaningful error messages for invalid SQL
- Properly prevents write operations if the server is read-only
- Query execution times are reasonable

This evaluation tests SQL query capabilities, schema introspection, and security controls.
