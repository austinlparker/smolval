Performance benchmark test to measure MCP server response times and throughput:

1. Measure baseline performance by listing files in a directory 5 times and recording the average time
2. Test file reading performance by reading 10 different files sequentially and measuring total time
3. Measure concurrent operation handling by requesting multiple file operations simultaneously
4. Test large file handling by reading a file larger than 1MB (create one if needed)
5. Benchmark search operations by finding all files with specific extensions (.py, .js, .md)
6. Test memory usage by performing 20 consecutive file operations without cleanup
7. Measure error recovery time by triggering an error and then performing a successful operation

Performance targets:
- Directory listing: < 2 seconds per operation
- File reading: < 1 second per file for files under 100KB
- Large file reading: < 5 seconds for files up to 10MB
- Search operations: < 3 seconds for recursive directory search
- Error recovery: < 1 second to return to normal operation
- Memory usage: No significant memory leaks over 20 operations

Success criteria:
- All operations complete within target times
- No memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- Error recovery is fast and reliable
- Performance is consistent across multiple runs
- Server remains responsive throughout the test
