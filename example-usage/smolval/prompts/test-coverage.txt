Analyze the testing approach and coverage in this codebase:

1. **Test Discovery**: Find all test files and testing frameworks used
2. **Test Types**: Identify different types of tests:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance tests
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Examine which parts of the code are tested
4. **Test Quality**: Review test structure and patterns:
   - Test organization
   - Test naming conventions
   - Setup/teardown patterns
   - Mocking strategies
5. **Missing Tests**: Identify critical paths that lack test coverage
6. **Test Configuration**: Review testing configuration and CI setup

Provide:
- Overview of current testing strategy
- Assessment of test coverage gaps
- Recommendations for improving test quality
- Suggestions for additional test types needed
- Examples of critical functions that should be tested
