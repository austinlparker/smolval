Perform a security review of this codebase:

1. **Dependency Security**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **Code Patterns**: Look for common security anti-patterns:
   - Hardcoded secrets or API keys
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Insecure file operations
   - Weak authentication/authorization
3. **Configuration Security**: Review configuration files for security issues
4. **Environment Variables**: Check how sensitive data is handled
5. **Input Validation**: Examine user input handling and validation
6. **Docker Security**: If Dockerfiles exist, review for security best practices

Provide:
- A list of potential security issues found
- Severity assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Specific recommendations for remediation
- Best practices that should be implemented
