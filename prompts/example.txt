Test the basic functionality of the MCP servers by performing these tasks:

1. List the files in the current directory to understand the project structure
2. If you find any interesting files (like README, documentation, or example files), read their contents
3. Try to fetch content from a simple webpage (like https://example.com) to test the web fetching capability
4. Summarize what you learned about the project and the capabilities of the MCP servers

This evaluation will help verify that the MCP servers are working correctly and can handle file operations, web requests, and provide useful responses.
