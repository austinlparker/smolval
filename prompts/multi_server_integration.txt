Please use multiple MCP tools in combination to:

1. Create a project directory structure using filesystem tools
2. Store project metadata in memory (name, purpose, creation date)
3. Create a simple SQLite database with a "tasks" table
4. Insert some sample task data into the database
5. Query the database to retrieve all tasks
6. Save the query results to a file called "project_tasks.json"
7. Use memory to recall the project details you stored earlier
8. Create a final project summary combining all the information

Expected outcome: Successfully demonstrate multi-server coordination and data flow.

Success criteria:
- Directory structure created successfully
- Project metadata stored and retrieved from memory
- Database created with sample data
- Query results exported to JSON file
- Memory retrieval works correctly
- Final summary combines all data sources
- Operations completed within 75 seconds
