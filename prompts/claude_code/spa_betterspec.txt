Create a single-page application (SPA) guest book. Place it in a folder named 'guestbook-spa'.The app should have a clean, accessible interface that allows users to:
	•	Enter their name
	•	Leave a message

Submitted entries should appear instantly in a list below the form, showing the name, message, and the submission time. No authentication or backend is needed—keep everything in memory.

Technical and Style Guidance:
	•	CSS:
	•	Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling, or, if not available, use BEM naming conventions with vanilla CSS.
	•	The UI should be visually appealing and accessible (good contrast, focus styles, readable fonts).
	•	Layout should be responsive and center the guest book on the page.
	•	Add spacing (padding/margin) to separate the form from the entry list.
	•	Style form controls and the submit button with clear hover/focus states.
	•	JavaScript:
	•	Use functional, component-based patterns (e.g., React functional components and hooks if using React).
	•	Validate the form so both fields are required before submission.
	•	After submission, clear the form and show a short success message.
	•	Prefer idiomatic, modern JavaScript (ES6+).

Bonus:
	•	Store entries in localStorage so the list persists on page reload.
